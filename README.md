# Mineral-Identification
UPDATE 6/6/23: Database and integrated Mineral list are finished!!!
Watch for any more updates: list of equipment needed, fun facts about your mineral, maybe even a website version??? Stay tuned :)

This Mineral ID program asks you questions about a mineral you are trying to identify until the program is able to narrow it down from an internal list.
- The list of minerals and the definitions you need to know will be accessible before you run the program

# How to run
1. Clone this repo.
2. Change directory to the cloned repo.
3. Type "make" into the terminal.
4. Then type "./rock" into the terminal.

If you want to start again type "./rock" again.

If you want to clear unnecessary files from running the program, type "make clean".

- Note, you will have to start at step 3 again now.
