# Mineral-Identification
As of 6/6/23 there is a full database and mineral list.

This Mineral ID program asks you questions about a mineral you are trying to identify until the program is able to narrow it down from an internal list.
- The list of possible minerals will be accessible before you run the program

# How to run (using Linux assuming make is installed)
1. Clone this repo.
2. Change directory to the cloned repo.
3. Type "make" into the terminal.
4. Then type "./rock" into the terminal.

If you want to start again type "./rock" again.

If you want to clear unnecessary files from when the program ran, type "make clean".

- Note, you will have to start at step 3 again now.
